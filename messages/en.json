          {
            "question": "Q What documents are needed for online payments?",
            "answer": "Business registration, bank account copy, website (or SNS URL), and product pages are required. Some PG companies require e-commerce registration if not already registered. New businesses have strict screening criteria, so existing sales, factory, or purchase data must be accurate."
          },

            "question": "Q Can I process online card payments without a website?",

            "question": "Q How is manual payment processing possible?",
            "answer": "This refers to MOTO (Mail Order/Telephone Order) payment where card numbers are manually entered. Due to high risk, screening criteria are strict and security deposits may be required."

          {
            "question": "Q How is VAT reporting handled?",
            "answer": "Generally, merchants handle it directly, and PG companies issue tax invoices for fees. Prime Play provides purchase data generated by merchants, making the tax reporting process more convenient."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q How are merchant fees determined?",
            "answer": "Varies by industry and risk level, requiring consultation. Manual payments and non-store businesses typically have higher fees."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q What to do when customers request refunds after payment?",
            "answer": "Merchants must cancel directly through PG company admin pages or request from PG companies. Refunds after settlement are processed as cash refunds."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q How to respond to chargebacks?",
            "answer": "When requested by card companies or PG companies, documents like order forms, shipping records, and customer consent are required. Failure to submit results in merchant liability."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q Are payments possible for services without direct product delivery?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Q How are fees and VAT calculated during settlement?",
            "answer": "PG fees are calculated based on VAT-inclusive amounts.\nExample: Sales 1,100,000 KRW â PG fee 3.3% = 36,300 KRW â Actual deposit = 1,100,000 - 36,300 = 1,063,700 KRW"

          },
          {
            "question": "Q Is app store registration possible?",

            "question": "Q Can development proceed without planning documents?",
            "answer": "Starting development without planning documents (screen designs, functional specifications) can extend timelines and cause communication issues. Minimum wireframes are essential after thorough consultation."
