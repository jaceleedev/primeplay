            "question": "Q What's the difference in required documents between individual and corporate business owners?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Q What documents are needed for online payments?",
            "answer": "Business registration, bank account copy, website (or SNS URL), and product pages are required. Some PG companies require e-commerce registration if not already registered. New businesses have strict screening criteria, so existing sales, factory, or purchase data must be accurate."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q Can I process online card payments without a website?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Q How is manual payment processing possible?",
            "answer": "This refers to MOTO (Mail Order/Telephone Order) payment where card numbers are manually entered. Due to high risk, screening criteria are strict and security deposits may be required."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q What documents are needed for manual payments?",
            "answer": "Credit sales agreement, customer ID/card photos, order forms, transaction proof documents, business registration, etc. are required."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q When are card payment proceeds settled?",
            "answer": "Domestic PG companies typically settle on D+3 business days, but Prime Play processes settlements immediately or next day depending on fees and conditions."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q Must the settlement account be under the business owner's name?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Q How long does it take from application to payment processing?",
            "answer": "Simple payment: Same day to 2 days\nOnline shopping mall integration: Usually within 2 weeks including API development and screening\nManual payment: 3+ days for screening and contract"
          },
          {
            "question": "Q Do I need to install a separate card terminal after PG contract?",
            "answer": "Online payments don't require terminals. For offline card payments, a separate terminal installation is needed. Terminal contracts offer purchase or rental options. Rentals require 1-year commitment and communication fee payments."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q How is VAT reporting handled?",
            "answer": "Generally, merchants handle it directly, and PG companies issue tax invoices for fees. Prime Play provides purchase data generated by merchants, making the tax reporting process more convenient."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q How are merchant fees determined?",
            "answer": "Varies by industry and risk level, requiring consultation. Manual payments and non-store businesses typically have higher fees."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q What to do when customers request refunds after payment?",
            "answer": "Merchants must cancel directly through PG company admin pages or request from PG companies. Refunds after settlement are processed as cash refunds."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q How to respond to chargebacks?",
            "answer": "When requested by card companies or PG companies, documents like order forms, shipping records, and customer consent are required. Failure to submit results in merchant liability."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q Are payments possible for services without direct product delivery?",

          {
            "question": "Q Can I sell through SNS or blogs only?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Q How are fees and VAT calculated during settlement?",
            "answer": "PG fees are calculated based on VAT-inclusive amounts.\nExample: Sales 1,100,000 KRW → PG fee 3.3% = 36,300 KRW → Actual deposit = 1,100,000 - 36,300 = 1,063,700 KRW"

          {
            "question": "Q Can one PG account be used for multiple sites?",

            "question": "Q What development costs should I expect?",

          {
            "question": "Q Can web and app be developed simultaneously?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Q Is app store registration possible?",
            "answer": "App store registration requires developer registration with additional costs. Some development options may face app store rejection, requiring detailed consultation."
          },
          {
            "question": "Q Can development proceed without planning documents?",
            "answer": "Starting development without planning documents (screen designs, functional specifications) can extend timelines and cause communication issues. Minimum wireframes are essential after thorough consultation."

          },
          {
            "question": "Q Is payment system (PG) integration difficult?",

          },
          {
            "question": "Q How to operate after development? (Server/DB etc.)",
            "answer": "Typically deployed to cloud servers (AWS, Cafe 24, Gabia, etc.). Apps require store registration, web requires domain connection and hosting setup. Operations require developer assistance for troubleshooting, DB backup, and security updates."
